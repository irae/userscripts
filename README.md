IraÃª's UserScripts
==================

This is my personal user scripts repo. Most of them were made and tested only in Firefox, on the date of the commit. If you find some of them useful and it's not working for you, you can fix it and send me a pull request or a patch, I'll be glad to receive then, but if you have no programming knowledge, drop me a message and I'll see what I can do.

Cheers!
